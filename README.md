### Flight Routes Manager   

#### **Introduction**  
The **Flight Routes Manager** is a Java-based console application that simulates a network of cities connected by flight routes using a **graph data structure**. This tool provides a practical way to visualize and manage airline routes while offering an educational experience in implementing graph structures and traversal algorithms like **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**. Whether you're a student, developer, or educator, this application serves as a valuable resource for understanding graph theory and its real-world applications.

#### **Features and Capabilities**  

1. **Add Cities**:  
   - Users can add cities (nodes) to the flight network.  

2. **Establish Flight Routes**:  
   - Enables users to create bidirectional connections (edges) between cities, simulating flight routes.  

3. **Display Network**:  
   - Displays all cities and their connections, providing a clear view of the flight network's structure.  

4. **Find Shortest Path**:  
   - Implements the **BFS algorithm** to calculate the shortest path between two cities, demonstrating efficient graph traversal techniques.  

5. **Educational Utility**:  
   - Introduces users to concepts of graph theory, including nodes, edges, and traversal methods.  
   - Can be used as a teaching aid or a template for graph-related projects.
